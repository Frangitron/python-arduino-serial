# Python Arduino Serial

Bidirectionnal serial communication (C Structs and Python Dataclasses) between Python and Arduino

- declare type hinted Dataclasses in Python
- generate C Header files
- send and receive data from both Python and Arduino through serial communication

## Usage

- Data serialization examples can be found in [the tests](tests/test_bytes_serialization.py)
- Header generation example can be found in [the tests](tests/test_c_header_exporter.py)
